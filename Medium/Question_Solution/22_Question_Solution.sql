-- The Employee table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, a salary, and there is also a column for the department Id.

-- +----+-------+--------+--------------+
-- | Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
-- +----+-------+--------+--------------+
-- | 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
-- | 2  | Jim   | 90000  | 1            |
-- | 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
-- | 4  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
-- | 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
-- +----+-------+--------+--------------+
-- The Department table holds all departments of the company.

-- +----+----------+
-- | Id | Name     |
-- +----+----------+
-- | 1  | IT       |
-- | 2  | Sales    |
-- +----+----------+
-- Write a SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments. 
-- For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).

-- +------------+----------+--------+
-- | Department | Employee | Salary |
-- +------------+----------+--------+
-- | IT         | Max      | 90000  |
-- | IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
-- | Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
-- +------------+----------+--------+

with highest_Salary as(
 select *,
 DENSE_RANK() over(PARTITION BY departmentid order by salary desc) as rn
 from employee
)
select dp.name Department, hs.name as Employee, salary from highest_Salary hs join Department dp on dp.id = hs.departmentid
where rn =1;
